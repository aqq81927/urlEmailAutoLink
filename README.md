# urlEmailAutoLink
Sometimes we use URL regular expression to find  [http,https or www] web url and then replace HTML tags.
However, URL regular expression also includes like kkk@gmail.com, aaa@yahoo.com.tw and so on.
At the same time, you also need to use Email regular expression to let email have a link tag 
like(<a herf="mailto:someone>someone</a>).
So this js can help you separate Email and Url, and both have correct HTML tag.
